# 2024 POTUS Candidate Website Screenshots

This repo uses GitHub Actions and [shot-scraper](https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper) to take screenshots twice a day of the websites for declared and possible candidates in the 2024 election for President of the United States of America.

The list of candidates is in [shots.yml](https://github.com/tomcook/2024-potus-candidate-sites/blob/main/shots.yml) and the screenshots are stored in [screenshots/](https://github.com/tomcook/2024-potus-candidate-sites/tree/main/screenshots). The screenshots are committed directly to the git repo so it's easy to see how they change over time in the git history.

## TODO

- Mastodon bot to toot screenshots when the sites have changed
